#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?( print will be a excellent built in function for output of data ) 

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?(input)

#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. (complexity is a storage of a group code a box of cords example the human brain ,abstraction is a simplified organized code for friendly to the average person example a subway suffers)

#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?(that your python writing grammer is incorect )

#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code. (a varible is a cup for the liquid of data)

#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.  

#7. What is a function definition and a function call? (a function definition is a name/title of a funtion a function call is when you call on a function on command)

#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal
# == // double equal
# != // exclaimation equal

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?3+('3')
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)
3+('3')

#10. What will the output for the following code block be? [20, 40, 60, 80]

listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?

# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?

# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?(to see true or false example ('cat or dog')

# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
