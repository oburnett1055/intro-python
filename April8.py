#2. Create a function that uses a while loop to determine if a user has typed in 
# the the correct word guess. If the user types in the wrong word, your program 
# should inform them that their guess was inccorect and to try again, but if the
# user guesses the word correctly, your program shoul tell the user they have 
# guessed correctly and have won the game, stopping the loop.

code='yes'
