#paragraph 1 idea

#My app idea is to make a auto nick name generater.This app will print out a unique nick name based off of 4 factors (favorite ), name , hobby , sports, animals ).
#based off the input of the user the app will then proceed to connect these 4 factors via random listings all indivisual that will relie on a len like built in function to scan the input for the 
#lenght of the input from  1 to 10.The info from the len in put will all be formed in a unison form in a patten not in the view of the user but the coder using a random range 1 to 3 that will chose a different pattern base off the indivisual integer.


#what problem does my app solve
